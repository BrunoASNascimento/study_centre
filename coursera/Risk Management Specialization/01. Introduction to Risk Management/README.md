## What is Risk?

Let's start with what is risk? Risk is the potential for deviation from an expected result. We have risk in our daily lives as well as being risk managers. But when you look at risk, what you're trying to measure is the probability that something is going to happen differently than what you expected. Essentially, that's what we're trying to measure as risk managers. If we could measure that potential for the deviation, then that is actually what you begin managing because you're managing it toward your expectations. Risk management is also divided into three disciplines. There's market risk, credit risk, and operational risk. Market risk is the risk you have toward asset prices, interest rates, some type of asset. Credit risk on the other hand is counterparty credit risk. Essentially, somebody owes you money, but that could also have actually come out of an operational process. Operational risk is people, process systems, and external events. If you take out market and credit risk, largely the residual risk that's left over is generally considered operational risk. Enterprise risk is a relatively recent and function within risk-management. Unlike market, credit, and operational risk, however, enterprise risk is a process. It's a process that tries to align risk-management with corporate strategy, but in order to do that, enterprise risk has to have a facilitation process that works with market credit and operational risk in order to provide a holistic and portfolio view of risk. Risk does not happen in isolated events. Generally, when you look at large events, there's some type of interconnectedness between the risk disciplines. As an example, let's take a walk through COVID-19. COVID-19 started in a single province. It was a health and safety event. As a health and safety event, COVID-19 started as an operational risk. From this initial operational risk related to health and safety, what was called into question is concern around Chinese economic growth. Because China is a linchpin, especially in the global manufacturing chain, concern around Chinese growth then led to concern around global growth. From this operational risk then, what we saw is an asset price correction through market risk. Then as a response to the asset price correction, you saw central banks as well as governments providing economic and fiscal stimulus in order to avoid contagion going from the asset price correction to counterparty risk. What we did not see with the economic downturn coming out of COVID-19, we did not see the level of counterparty risk concern that we had in the 2008 downturn. That was largely because of the fiscal and monetary stimulus from the central banks as well as governments. However, coming out of COVID-19, we did see that the major global institutions did supplement that loan loss reserves because what they were getting ready for are potential write-offs further down the road as COVID-19 begins to run its course. What we basically saw with COVID-19 and the current pandemic, is the linking of each of the risk disciplines and how it affects one going into the other. As risk managers, we need to take into account both quantitative analysis as well as qualitative analysis, and COVID-19 is a perfect example of that. But let's take a look now at how we measure risk.

## Measuring Different Types of Risk

When you look at data, data could be stratified in any number of ways. As risk managers, we're very dependent on data. One way to look at it is to classify it by what's called known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns. I know that sounds quirky, but let's take it one step at a time. Known knowns is, you know the probability of something and you know what the potential impact is. When you look at known unknowns, you may know that something exist, but what you don't know is when it is actually going to manifest itself. Now, this category in taking a look at trying to measure risk, goes into the realm of emerging risk and strategic risk. As an example, with climate change, there could be the potential for rising sea levels. We know that's a potential, but we don't know when it's going to happen. There are various models that project it, but nobody really knows that with uncertainty, so that goes into the concept of known unknowns. The reason why risk managers put things into data classifications like that is each one of them has a different response in monitoring mechanisms. Emerging risk is getting a lot of attention, especially recently, because of the level of volatility that we've seen in the 21st century. To put in perspective the volatility of the 21st century, think about the associates entering the workforce today. They have lived through 9/11 to 2008 downturn, as well as the current pandemic. In-between those three larger events, there were other significant events that actually happened. The third category of data classification are unknown unknowns. In risk management, we often refer to these as completely random events. Random events happen. As risk managers, we need to work with our management team in order to have escalation protocols in place that help firms actually manage any event of a completely random event. When you look at risk, risk management is a dynamic process. First, we need to identify the risk, we need to determine the probability and impact, we also need to determine from a decision-making perspective, what risks do we assume, what risks do we accept, and what risks do we want to avoid. Then risk managers need to have monitoring mechanisms because that's where the management comes into place. You have these monitoring mechanisms to where you're constantly evaluating the known knowns, especially the known unknowns. But you also have to have in place the protocols and escalation protocols, especially to where you can actually manage completely random events, and that goes into event management as well as crisis management. One of the key analytical processes risk managers use is root cause analysis. When things happen, we have to learn from them and we then have to make adjustments to it. It's very imperative for risk managers to have a proper root cause analysis because with the root cause analysis, that could show certain flaws within our risk management systems, and then we need to plug that. Risk management also should help a firm anticipate risk events, and this is becoming more important over time. To put it in perspective, what's at stake, look at the original listing of the Fortune 500 companies that goes back to the 1950s, nearly two-thirds of the original Fortune 500 companies are no longer in business, and the speed with which changes are occurring is actually happening at a faster and faster rate. Many of these companies were highly successful, but they didn't anticipate changes to the marketplace. Risk management is dynamic process, but it is also forward-looking. It's not just about avoiding risk, it's about anticipating risk, and in some cases, we want to avoid it, in some cases we may elect to pursue risk. What you want to do is to have a decision based on the analysis to where you have a good risk adjusted return. At this point, what I'd like to do now is we're going to introduce market risk.

### Understanding Liquidity Risk

#### Liquidity Risk by Joseph A. Iraci

Liquidity risk is a key source of financial risk, and liquidity refers to the speed within which an asset can be converted into cash. In addition to converting assets to cash, firms use a variety of other tools to manage liquidity risk including lines of credit, securitizations, and money market activity.

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has not instituted formal capital charges to cover liquidity risk because liquidity is less suited to formal risk measurement. However, the Basel Committee stated “Liquidity is crucial to the ongoing viability of any banking organization. Bank’s capital positions can have an effect on their ability to obtain liquidity, especially in a crisis.” The ability to liquidate assets to generate cash is very dependent on market conditions, and these conditions impact bid / ask spreads and liquidation time horizon.

Lack of liquidity can cause a firm to fail even when it is technically solvent (assets being greater than liabilities). Liquidity is the life blood of financial services, and lack of liquidity can cause a run on any financial firm as clients seek to get their cash. Liquidity risk consists of both asset liquidity risk and funding liquidity risk. The Committee of European Banking Supervisors defines them as:

Asset Liquidity Risk: Also called market / product liquidity risk. It is the risk that a position cannot easily be unwound or offset at short notice without significantly influencing the market price, because of inadequate market depth or market disruption.

Funding Liquidity Risk: It is the current or prospective risk arising from an institution’s inability to meet its liabilities and obligations as they come due without incurring unacceptable losses.

These risks interact and impact a portfolio that contains illiquid assets that may have to be sold at distressed prices to raise funding. Assessing liquidity risk starts with understanding market conditions. The bid / ask spread measures to cost of buying and selling an amount within a normal market size. A market that has high liquidity will have a narrow bid / ask spread. For example, the US Treasury market. Conversely, a market that has low liquidity will have a wider bid / ask spread. For example, the junk bond market. The US Treasury market has much more depth than does the junk bond market thus its spread is very narrow.

When a market lacks depth, large transactions can impact the market and liquidity can vary greatly across asset classes and can vary by security type. For example, liquidating illiquid securities generally is still much faster than trying to liquidate real estate. Asset liquidity risk depends on several factors:

- Market conditions

- Liquidation time horizon

- Asset and security type

- Asset fungibility

Liquidity risk has been a major factor in many crises impacting both credit risk and market risk. Funding liquidity risk arises from the liability side, for both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. Liabilities can be classified as core or volatile, where each term refers to the predictability of cash flows. For example, if a bank relies on statement savings accounts for funding, it has stable funding when compared to a bank that relies on certificates of deposit that come from brokers. Funding gaps can also be met by asset sales. Cash and liquid assets provide a cushion that can be used to support funding needs.

Liquidity risk should have adequate governance structures and tools in order to measure, monitor, and manage liquidity risk. There is no single measure of liquidity risk, firms typically use a range of metrics to assess liquidity risk. Liquidity risk management, however, usually starts with operational liquidity, which establishes the daily cash needs by forecasting all cash inflows versus outflows. Once operational liquidity is assessed, the next step is usually an analysis of a firm’s access to unsecured funding sources and the liquidity profile of its asset base. This information is integrated into a strategic perspective that looks at current assets, current liabilities, and off-balance sheet items.

A funding matrix is built that shows funding needs for various maturities. Any funding gap should be addressed by plans to raise additional liquidity through either borrowing or asset sales. A contingency funding plan establishes a plan of action should one of the liquidity stress scenarios develop. When a crisis hits, management usually has no time react, thus a pre-established plan is useful.
## Introduction to Market Risk
### Market Risk

Let's now take a look at market risk. Think of risk management as part art and part science. When you look at market risk, market risk for risk management is more of the science. When you go past market risk into credit risk, it becomes a little more on the art side. As you go then from credit risk to operational risk, operational risk could be considered more art than science. Regardless of whether it's quantitative or qualitative, it takes a combination of both quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis for good risk management. While market risk is the most quantitative of the risk disciplines, there is a qualitative aspect even to market risk. But at its core, what market risk management seeks to do is to utilize market data as well as statistical measures in order to identify, assess, and measure risk to create economic value. The goal of risk management is not necessarily to minimize risk; the goal of risk management is to have a good risk adjusted return for the risk you assume. Risk should always be on a going forward basis.

### Measuring Market Risk
 When looking at measuring market risk, what you want to do is you want to take a look at the level of risk you're assuming, but you also want to make sure that you're not assuming an undue level of risk.
Statistical measures that are often used in market risk management include things like the mean, which is the average. Standard deviation, the standard deviation measures deviations from the mean.
But you also have to take a look at value at risk, which the value at risk is the confidence level under the normal distribution up to the confidence level of which you're trying to measure the value at risk. When you look at the normal distribution, the normal distribution is known as that bell shaped curve. In the middle of the bell shaped curve, the mean is the middle of the bell shaped curve. At that point, the mean is actually 0, and then what the normal distribution then does is the normal distribution measures the deviations from the mean.
Generally, 68% of the observations are within one standard deviation of the mean. 95% are within two standard deviations, and about 99% are within three standard deviations.
The normal distribution works especially with returns and yields, the more you add to the sample, the closer you get to that normal distribution. When you look at asset prices however, asset prices have log normal distribution which is actually skewed to the right. The reason why its log normal is that in theory, asset prices don't go negative, the as you could have a negative return.
That theory face the reality in 2020, however. And what the markets actually saw in 2020 was the prices of oil in the futures contract actually went negative. And the reason why it went negative is it was taking into account the cost of storing the oil versus the cost of the underlying commodity. And what we saw is a disconnect between the futures market and actually the cash market. But oil itself never went negative, it was the futures contract that went negative.
So what stands to be seen going forward right now is, is there the potential for any commodity that pays for storage to actually have a negative futures contract? But we'll get more into the log normal distribution more, but what I wanted to introduce with this is the normal distribution. Because the normal distribution is one of the bedrock distributions that we use within market risk, because of the variation of yields, as well as rates and returns on underlying assets.
When you look at measuring market risk, a number in isolation is very difficult to put in perspective whether or not it's good or bad.
So when you're trying to measure market risk, what you always want to do is you want to measure it against the benchmark. The reason why you want to measure it against the benchmark is you need a comparison. That comparison helps you determine if you're taking on too much risk or if you're not taking on enough risk.
The benchmark allows that comparison in order to try to determine when you're looking at evaluation and a portfolio, whether or not it's actually sufficient. So having a good benchmark is very critical to the measurement of market risk.
